Python Financial Planning App (EMPOWER)

This Python code provides a basic framework for a financial planning application. It uses a SQLite database to store user information, accounts, transactions, and other financial data.

**Features:**

**##User authentication**
Adding transactions (with categories and optional payee/memo)
Calculating net worth (simplified version)

**##Requirements:**

Python 3
sqlite3 library

**##Setup:**

Created a database file named finance.db.
This code uses a very basic user authentication mechanism. More secure password hashing will be implemented in production.

**##Usage:**

The code includes functions for user management, adding transactions, and calculating net worth. 


This is a prototype. A production-ready application would require additional functionalities, security measures, and error handling.

Further Development:

Implemention of more comprehensive user authentication and authorization.
 Support for multiple accounts and categories.
Functionalities for managing budgets, setting financial goals, and generating reports.
Use of an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for a more efficient database interaction.
